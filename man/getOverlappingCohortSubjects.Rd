\usage{
getOverlappingCohortSubjects(
  cdm,
  targetCohortName,
  targetCohortId = NULL,
  overlapCohortName,
  overlapCohortId = NULL,
  lookbackWindow = 0,
  multipleEvents = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{cdm}{CDMConnector CDM reference object}

\item{targetCohortName}{name of the cohort that we want to add the
overlapping}

\item{targetCohortId}{id or vector of ids, of the target cohort}

\item{overlapCohortName}{name of the cohort that we want to check if
overlaps with the target cohort}

\item{overlapCohortId}{id or vector of ids, of the cohort we are interested
in}

\item{lookbackWindow}{lookback period window in days, a list consist of two
numbers}

\item{multipleEvents}{if we want to count the number of evenets (TRUE) then
the result is an integer orjust their presence (FALSE) then the result is 1
or 0.}
}
\value{
it add a new column to target cohort for each id in overlap cohort.
The column is numeric and can be 0 if no overlap is observed and 1 if overlap
is observed.
